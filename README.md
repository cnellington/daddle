# Schnoob Wordle

This is a clone project of the popular word guessing game we all know and love. Made using React, Typescript, and Tailwind, for my dad on Father's Day 2023.

## Build and run

The app will rebuild and deploy whenever new changes are pushed to main. 
- Update the `WORDS` array in [src/constants/wordlist.ts](src/constants/wordlist.ts) to include words of any of the variable lengths desired.
- Update the `VALID_GUESSES` array in [src/constants/validGuesses.ts](src/constants/validGuesses.ts) to include words of any of the variable lengths desired.
- Or update the customwords.txt in [src/constants/customwords.txt](src/constants/customwords.txt) and run the `formatter.py` to automatically update the words and valid guesses.
